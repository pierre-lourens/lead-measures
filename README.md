# lead

This side project is about my belief that good outcomes from paying attention to lead measures, not lag measures.

Plans:

- [ ] Create a react front end, so that I can practice hooks. (I work in Angular these days.)
- [ ] Figure out what I want to do for the back end.
- [ ] One day, explore a mobile app?
